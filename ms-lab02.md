Microservices
==============================


## Lab 2 â€“ Creating Microservices

In the last lab we selected languages and tools for our Microservices platform. In this lab we will create a
microservice which manages the trash can inventory for our trash can distributed application. This application will have
a microservice architecture which is one of the primary prerequisites for cloud native applications.

The Cloud Native Compute Foundation (CNCF) defines "cloud native systems" as having three key properties:

- *Container packaged.* Running applications and processes in software containers as an isolated unit of application
  deployment, and as a mechanism to achieve high levels of resource isolation. Improves overall developer experience,
  fosters code and component reuse and simplifies operations for cloud native applications.
- *Dynamically managed.* Actively scheduled and actively managed by a central orchestrating process. Radically improves
  machine efficiency and resource utilization while reducing the cost associated with maintenance and operations.
- *Micro-services oriented.* Loosely coupled with dependencies explicitly described (e.g. through service endpoints).
  Significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.

To begin this lab we'll add support for Trash can data storage and retrieval in our microservice skeleton from Lab 1.


### 1. Building the inventory service

To build a proper REST interface for our inventory service we should allow clients to add trash cans to the system and
then retrieve them. The "resource" in this case is a trash can. Therefore it might make sense to create an IRI in our
waste management application such as:

- /waste/cans

With /waste as the root of our application and /cans as the collection of trash cans.

The REST approach typically involves creating APIs based on resources and then using HTTP verbs to interact with those
resources. In a REST interface it would be fairly common to allow new cans to be POSTed to the collection and allow
users to GET existing cans from the collection, using a path parameter such as:

- /waste/cans/{can-id}

Using GET on the cans collection should return all of the cans (or one page of cans with semantics for retrieving the
next page).

To begin let's add support for POSTing new cans to the /waste/cans IRI and support for GETing all of the registered
cans. To start we will simply house all of the data in memory. This is not a long term solution but it will be
sufficient during the early development phase as we learn about our application, its problem domain and the structure of
trash can data. We'll be much better prepared to select a storage solution after some basic experience with real data.

Open the inv.py skeleton from lab 1 and begin by adding a Python dictionary called wcans to the end of the file. We'll
use the wcans dictionary to house our can data in the prototype microservice.

```Python
""" Trash Can Inventory Service
"""

from flask import Flask
from flask import jsonify
from flask import request

app = Flask(__name__)

VERSION = "0.1"

@app.route('/')
def version():
    """ Root IRI returns the API version """
    return jsonify(version=VERSION)


wcans = {}
```

Now we can add a handler for the /waste/cans route. Add the following cans() function to the bottom of your inv.py file:

```Python
@app.route('/waste/cans', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def cans():
    """ /cans collection allows POST of new cans and GET of all cans """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        can = request.get_json()
        wcans[can["id"]] = can
        return jsonify(can), 201
    else:  #GET
        return jsonify(list(wcans.values()))
```

The cans() handler function (called a view function in Flask) responds to GET and POST HTTP requests. POST requests must
pass a JSON formatted Trash Can to the API. The cans() code gets the JSON body from the request and saves it in a
variable  called can. The can is then saved into the waste cans dictionary, wcans, with the can id as the key.

REST API clients expect new resource requests to return the object created and a 201 status for "Created". The Flask
jsonify() function allows us to easily return the JSON representation of the accepted can along with the 201 status
code.

If the user is using the GET verb on the IRI we simply convert the values in the wcans dictionary into a list, turn that
into a JSON string and return it. The jsonify() function returns a 200 status (Ok) by default.


### 2. Testing the inventory service

At this point we have made the smallest testable increment to our code. Modern development sensibilities typically
suggest that we should have either already written a test for this functionality (Test Driven Development, TDD) or that
we should write tests now. By writing tests and checking them in with our code we can ensure that our code does not
regress and our tests can also act as example code for API users.

Given the amount of material we have to cover here we will simply test the interface by hand. Take a look at the RX-M
TDD course offerings if you are interested in learning more about TDD and microservices.

We can use curl, a simple but powerful and agnostic tool, to test our REST APIs. First run your updated service:

```
(venv) user@ubuntu:~/trash-can/inv$ cat inv.py
```
```Python
""" Trash Can Inventory Service
"""

from flask import Flask
from flask import jsonify
from flask import request

app = Flask(__name__)

VERSION = "0.1"

@app.route('/')
def version():
    """ Root IRI returns the API version """
    return jsonify(version=VERSION)


wcans = {}


@app.route('/waste/cans', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def cans():
    """ /cans collection allows POST of new cans and GET of all cans """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        can = request.get_json()
        wcans[can["id"]] = can
        return jsonify(can), 201
    else:  #GET
        return jsonify(list(wcans.values()))
```
```
(venv) user@ubuntu:~/trash-can/inv$ python -m flask run -p 8080
 * Serving Flask app "inv"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now try curling the /wast/cans IRI:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ curl -vv localhost:8080/waste/cans
*   Trying ::1...
* connect to ::1 port 8080 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /waste/cans HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
>
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 3
< Server: Werkzeug/0.11.11 Python/2.7.12
< Date: Sun, 02 Oct 2016 20:23:43 GMT
<
[]
* Closing connection 0
user@ubuntu:~$
```

Because our service starts up with an empty wcans dictionary we receive an empty list of cans. The status is 200 OK so
things are working so far.

Next lets try POSTing a new can to the service:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ curl -vv -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"id": "42","deployed": "False","power": "grid","lat": "31.776","lon": "35.217","capacity": "500"}' http://localhost:8080/waste/cans

Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
*   Trying ::1...
* connect to ::1 port 8080 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> POST /waste/cans HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Type: application/json
> Content-Length: 98
>
* upload completely sent off: 98 out of 98 bytes
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 123
< Server: Werkzeug/0.11.11 Python/2.7.12
< Date: Sun, 02 Oct 2016 20:25:37 GMT
<
{
  "capacity": "500",
  "deployed": "False",
  "id": "42",
  "lat": "31.776",
  "lon": "35.217",
  "power": "grid"
}
* Closing connection 0
```

The curl command we use to POST data requires several additional curl switches:

- -vv: Very Verbose
- -H: sets headers, here we must tell the service we are POSTing JSON, using the Content-Type header with the
  application/json media type
- -X: sets the HTTP verb to POST (the default operation when seting data but being explicit doesn't hurt!)
- -d: sets the data to transmit, the JSON formatted trash can data in our case

The curl output shows that our POST request returned a 201 created, indicating the service created a new resource in
response to our request. Any time a 201 status is returned the new object is expected to be returned, as indeed it was.
There are still some concerns however. First, all of our data is accepted without regard to the fields supplied or their
values. Second, a 201 response should also return a location header identifying the IRI where the new resource can be
found. We should address both of these issues.


### 3. API validation and Design by Contract

APIs are contracts, a set of agreements between the service and its clients as to what is and is not legal in an
interface exchange. All too often these contracts are implicit to a small or large degree.

Design By Contract (DbC) is a software correctness methodology that uses pre-conditions and post-conditions to document
(or programmatically assert) the change in state caused by a piece of a program, like an interface call. This type of
verification of state change can be particularly useful in free for interface systems such as REST. Mechanically, a user
could pass just about any type of JSON string and request that we add it as a new trash can.

To protect against this and document our interface requirements in one fell swoop, we can create a validation method that
ensures only valid trash can representations are added to the system. Add the following validation function to the
bottom of your inv.py source file.

```Python
def validate_can(can):
    """ DbC checks for required can fields and settings
            returns False if can is valid
            returns a string describing the error otherwise
    """
    try:
        #Test id
        can["id"] = int(can["id"])
        if can["id"] < 0 or 999999999 < can["id"]:
            raise ValueError("can.id out of range [0..999999999]")
        #Test deployed
        if can["deployed"] == "True":
            can["deployed"] = True
        elif can["deployed"] == "False":
            can["deployed"] = False
        else:
            raise ValueError("can.deployed must be Boolean (True, False)")
        #Test capacity
        can["capacity"] = float(can["capacity"])
        if can["capacity"] <= 0.0 or 9999 < can["capacity"]:
            raise ValueError("can.capacity out of range (0.0..9999.0]")
        #Test lat
        can["lat"] = float(can["lat"])
        if can["lat"] < -90.0 or 90.0 < can["lat"]:
            raise ValueError("can.lat out of range [-90.0..90.0]")
        #Test lon
        can["lon"] = float(can["lon"])
        if can["lon"] < -180.0 or 180.0 < can["lon"]:
            raise ValueError("can.lon out of range [-180.0..180.0]")
        #Test power
        if "power" not in can:
            raise ValueError("field 'power' must be present")
    except Exception as ex:
        return str(ex)
    return False #no errors
```

The validation function manipulates externally supplied data. This is always a dangerous process. Well built
microservices should not crash in the face of errors, rather they should report specific details describing the problem
through both the API and the logging system. The validate_can() function above converts JSON string data into the
appropriate Python data type. Beyond this the range of acceptable values is also tested.

Logging and monitoring microservices is particularly challenging and important. Challenging due to the great number of
services and service replicas. Important because error logging is one of the key forensic tools operations teams can use
to solve production problems.

Now modify your /waste/cans handler to test all POSTs with the new validation function and provide detailed logging in
the face of failure:

```Python
@app.route('/waste/cans', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def cans():
    """ /cans collection allows POST of new cans and GET of all cans """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        can = request.get_json()
        result = validate_can(can)
        if result:
            print("ERROR: " + request.url + " : " + result)
            return jsonify(error=result), 400
        wcans[can["id"]] = can
        return jsonify(can), 201
    else:  #GET
        return jsonify(list(wcans.values()))
```

The updated cans() function now validates all POST data and logs error data to the user through HTTP and to the console
via print(). As it turns out, Flask also reports all returned status codes returned for a given IRI.

Test the new validator by attempting to POST invalid can data. First verify your inv.py source and rerun Flask:

```
(venv) user@ubuntu:~/trash-can/inv$ cat inv.py
```
```Python
""" Trash Can Inventory Service

from flask import Flask
from flask import jsonify
from flask import request

app = Flask(__name__)

VERSION = "0.1"

@app.route('/')
def version():
    """ Root IRI returns the API version """
    return jsonify(version=VERSION)


wcans = {}


@app.route('/waste/cans', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def cans():
    """ /cans collection allows POST of new cans and GET of all cans """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        can = request.get_json()
        result = validate_can(can)
        if result:
            print("ERROR: " + request.url + " : " + result)
            return jsonify(error=result), 400
        wcans[can["id"]] = can
        return jsonify(can), 201
    else:  #GET
        return jsonify(list(wcans.values()))

        #Test deployed

            can["deployed"] = True
        elif can["deployed"] == "False":
            can["deployed"] = False
        else:

 * Serving Flask app "inv"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

Now try to POST a trash can with a capacity of 0:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ curl -vv -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"id": "57","deployed": "True","power": "solar","lat": "31.776","lon": "35.217","capacity": "0"}' http://localhost:8080/waste/cans

Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
*   Trying ::1...
* connect to ::1 port 8080 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> POST /waste/cans HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080

<
{
  "error": "can.capacity out of range (0.0..9999.0]"
}
* Closing connection 0
user@ubuntu:~$
```

This fails with a 400 status and a helpful error message. Examine the Flask console output:

```
(venv) user@ubuntu:~/trash-can/inv$ python -m flask run -p 8080
 * Serving Flask app "inv"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:20:17] "POST /waste/cans HTTP/1.1" 400 -
```

We have a clear "ERROR" statement in the log (easy to search for with analytics tools) and the full IRI of the resource
along with the application specific error.


### 4. Path parameters and individual resource retrieval

As a final step we want to make sure that clients can retrieve an individual trash can and also remove them. We can use
a path parameter to select a specific can from the cans resource collection. For example the route `/waste/cans/42`
would be used to refer to the can with the ID 42.

Add the following code to your inventory microservice to complete its API feature set:

```Python
@app.route('/waste/cans/<int:can_id>', methods=['GET', 'DELETE'])
def can(can_id):
    """ can id can be used as a /cans path param to GET/DELETE a single can """
    if can_id not in wcans:
        return jsonify(error="trash can id not found"), 404
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return jsonify(wcans[can_id])
    elif request.method == 'DELETE':
        del wcans[can_id]
        return ('', 204)
    else:
        return jsonify(error="bad HTTP verb, only GET and DELETE supported"), 400
```

This function accepts an integer path parameter with either the GET or DELETE verb. The first if condition ensures that
a valid ID has been presented. The second if condition returns the appropriate can in response to a GET operation. The
associated elif handles the DELETE verb and all other verbs produce an error.

Run the updated service:

```
(venv) user@ubuntu:~/trash-can/inv$ python -m flask run -p 8080
 * Serving Flask app "inv"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 ```

To test the new functionality we can add a couple of cans and then try to display them individually:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ curl -vv -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"id": "42","deployed": "False","power": "grid","lat": "31.776","lon": "35.217","capacity": "500"}' http://localhost:8080/waste/cans

As expected the DELETE verb removes the unwanted can. Your service console log should look something like this:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:42:10] "POST /waste/cans HTTP/1.1" 201 -
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:42:19] "POST /waste/cans HTTP/1.1" 201 -
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:42:29] "GET /waste/cans/42 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:42:43] "GET /waste/cans HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:43:07] "DELETE /waste/cans/42 HTTP/1.1" 204 -
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2016 14:43:15] "GET /waste/cans HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

The log makes it easy to see the state changes made to our inventory.


### 5. HATEOS

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of the REST application architecture. A
hypermedia-driven site provides information to navigate the site's REST interfaces dynamically by including hypermedia
links with the responses.

At present our reposes are all data. The responses that might currently benefit from HATEOS are the GET and
POST operations on the /waste/cans IRI. In the GET data it might be nice if each resource in the list included its own
IRI. You might say that the IRI is well known, /waste/cans/{can_id}. Well it is certainly well known to us, but what
about our users? What if we decide to move the resources and change the IRI? In the simple example we have here, this
may be a little far fetched but it is a common occurrence in REST APIs. Whenever possible we should avoid explicit
resource paths in lieu of discovered resource paths. This gives us the freedom to change and move IRIs as our
architecture evolves.

Another opportunity for HATEOS in our API is the POST operation. In our prototype, the POST object includes the can ID.
What if, as we move to production, it becomes the service's responsibility to allocate IDs. How will the caller know
what ID was assigned to their object? It could remain in the JSON returned but it turns out that POST operations
creating a new resource are typically obliged to return a location header, identifying the path of the new resource.

Modify the POST code in your service to return an HTTP location header with the path of newly created resources:

```Python
@app.route('/waste/cans', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def cans():
    """ /cans collection allows POST of new cans and GET of all cans """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        can = request.get_json()
        result = validate_can(can)
        if result:
            print("ERROR: " + request.url + " : " + result)
            return jsonify(error=result), 400
        wcans[can["id"]] = can
        response = jsonify(can)
        response.status_code = 201
        response.headers['Location'] = "/waste/cans/" + str(can["id"])
        response.autocorrect_location_header = False
        return response
    elif request.method == 'GET':
        return jsonify(list(wcans.values()))
    else:
        return jsonify(error="bad HTTP verb, only GET and POST supported"), 400
```

The `response.autocorrect_location_header = false` statement keeps Flask from changing the relative path set in our
location header. Now rerun your service to test it:

```
(venv) user@ubuntu:~/trash-can/inv$ python -m flask run -p 8080
 * Serving Flask app "inv"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now try POSTing a new can:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ curl -vv -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"id": "42","deployed": "False","power": "grid","lat": "31.776","lon": "35.217","capacity": "500"}' http://localhost:8080/waste/cans
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.

* connect to ::1 port 8080 failed: Connection refused

{
  "capacity": 500.0,
  "deployed": false,
  "id": 42,
  "lat": 31.776,
  "lon": 35.217,
  "power": "grid"
}
* Closing connection 0
user@ubuntu:~$
```

We now can use the Location header, in this case with the value `/waste/cans/42`, to access the resource we just
created. Try it:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ curl -vv localhost:8080/waste/cans/42

*   Trying ::1...
* connect to ::1 port 8080 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /waste/cans/42 HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
>
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK

  "lat": 31.776,
  "lon": 35.217,
  "power": "grid"
}
* Closing connection 0
user@ubuntu:~$
```

As advertised, the location header now points to the newly created resource. For more on designing effective REST apis
see the RX-M REST course offerings. In the labs ahead we'll learn how to package our services in containers, how to
work with multiple services, messages and more.
